🌱 About Me

Hello! My name is Yin. I'm presently located in the beautiful city of London, Ontario, Canada. I have embarked on an academic journey at the University of Western Ontario, where I am pursuing my second bachelor's degree, first degree in Computer Science. At the age of 36, this represents not just a change in my career trajectory, but a profound personal transformation. I am filled with anticipation and excitement about the limitless opportunities the tech industry has to offer. My decision to transition into this field has been a deliberated one, fueled by my keen interest in technological innovation and problem-solving. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence, data analytics, and cybersecurity.


👔 Professional Background

I bring along a wealth of experience from my 15-year tenure in the banking sector. I've had the privilege of working at two of the world's largest banking groups. These roles have equipped me with invaluable skills in financial analysis, risk assessment, customer service, and team management. My time in banking has also imbued me with a solid ethical framework and an acute understanding of the regulatory landscapes in multiple jurisdictions.


📚 Academic Interests

Beyond the world of zeros and ones, I possess an array of academic interests that span multiple disciplines. A lifelong passion for coding is just the tip of the iceberg. I have an insatiable curiosity for Chinese history, language, and politics. I find it thrilling to engage in intellectual dialogues that revolve around these subjects. The analytical skills acquired through my multidisciplinary academic pursuits significantly contribute to my problem-solving capabilities in tech and other fields. These are not mere interests but dimensions that shape my worldview, work ethics, and aspirations.


🏀 Hobbies & Interests

Outside the confines of work and academia, I indulge in the adrenaline-pumping game of basketball. I've always been a basketball aficionado, closely following the NBA. My admiration for the legendary Kobe Bryant is unbounded. His work ethic, dedication, and spirit of relentless improvement resonate deeply with me. I often find myself practicing on the court, attempting to emulate some of Kobe's iconic moves, and learning valuable life lessons through the lens of sport.
