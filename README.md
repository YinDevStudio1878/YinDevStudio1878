üå± About Me

Hello! I'm 'biliblippi', currently residing in the vibrant city of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, where I am pursuing my Honours Specialization in Computer Science at Western University. I bring with me a wealth of professional experience from my decade-long career in the banking sector, where I held various leadership roles, including branch management and corporate governance. At 35+, my journey represents a significant shift in my career trajectory, driven by a passion for technological innovation and problem-solving. I am currently on track to graduate in 2026, with a GPA of 3.9.

My academic focus is on scalable software development, network engineering, and cybersecurity, all areas where I am actively building expertise. Additionally, I am pursuing industry certifications, including CCNA, CISSP, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, and CompTIA A+, to further enhance my skills. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages and technologies, ranging from systems programming on UNIX/Linux to iOS and full-stack web development.

üëî Professional Background

During my tenure in banking, I gained expertise in financial analysis, risk management, and team leadership while navigating complex regulatory environments. Most recently, I held key management roles at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Canada). My transition to the tech industry has allowed me to apply the organizational skills and strategic mindset I honed in banking to software engineering and cybersecurity projects. Now, as an independent iOS and full-stack web developer, I manage my own studio, leveraging my knowledge of AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub to optimize productivity and streamline workflows.

üìö Academic Interests

Beyond Computer Science, I maintain a strong interest in Chinese history, language, and culture. This multidisciplinary approach fuels my intellectual curiosity and enhances my analytical skills, which I apply both in academic settings and real-world problem-solving scenarios. I believe that integrating these diverse perspectives contributes to more innovative and thoughtful solutions.

üèÄ Hobbies & Interests

When I‚Äôm not coding or studying, I‚Äôm on the basketball court. A lifelong basketball enthusiast, I‚Äôve been an admirer of Kobe Bryant, whose legendary work ethic and commitment to improvement inspire me both on and off the court. I often use basketball as a way to push myself beyond my limits and reflect on the principles of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.
